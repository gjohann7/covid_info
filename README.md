This Flutter project aims to show a data visualization on the COVID-19 status.

You can see more details about this project [here](https://gjohann7.github.io/covid_info/).

## Getting Started

If you already know how Flutter works, you can skip this section.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter, view our
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

## Installation

These instructions consider you already have a device emulator or
a real device. Also, they don't explain details about the device-computer
connection.

So, first of all, download the project on your computer, then use a device
emulator or connect your real device to your computer with the debugging
method enabled.

Open the terminal of your computer pointing to the project root directory -
`covid_info/`, type the `flutter run` instruction and then press the Enter key.
After that, if all run well, you won't need to worry about the computer
terminal anymore. As the last step, you will probably be asked to confirm the
app's installation on your device. There you go, the app should be available for
use.

## Usage

When you open the app for the first time, you will be asked to allow the app to
use your device's localization to get the data about your current country.

Therefore, you will be able to see some main information about global and country'
current status.

The first page of the app informs you about the app purpose, and also allows you
to go to the source of the data. You will have access to the app main tabs in all
pages of the app, they are the introductory, the global summary and the country
details ones.

In the global summary page, you can see some main aspects of the COVID-19 current
status. And while you are in the details page, you can check and interact with
others data visualizations.
