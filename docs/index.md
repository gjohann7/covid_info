## Application Goal and Who should use this App

The application goal is to provide people with updated information about COVID-19
status. It considers the whole world, as well as it does contemplate a country
perspective. Acknowledging its considerations, any user who holds an interest in
this subject may be pleased to use this app.

Therefore, the app affords the COVID-19's data visualization using charts to inform
and keep the user tuned about it. Yet, for those more concerned about the COVID-19
situation, the charts may provide insights to them.

## About technological choices

To develop the mobile app it was used Flutter. It is a Google's UI toolkit for crafting
beautiful, natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single
codebase. Therefore, the developed app can be used at least with either IOS and Android
devices.

With Flutter, the Visual Studio Code (VSCode) was chosen to integrate the development
tools. Also, in the VSCode, it was installed the Flutter extension (which can be found
[here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Dart-Code.flutter)) to
complete the set up of the development environment. As a personal choice, a real device
was used to run the app.

## Application Architecture and Features

The project was divided into these five sections (1) **Pages**, where the user interfaces (UI)
were designed, (2) **Logic aspect**, where the bridge between the app with the database controller
and the API were developed, (3) **Database**, where the database configurations were established,
(4) **Models**, where the models used in the app were defined, and (5) **Charts**, where all
used charts configurations and behaviors were set.

### Pages (UI) 

The first section was touch to be easy of use and intuitive. Yet, there was no such
beatiuful art to please the user. Also, the instructions to retrieve the localization
and then the current country name were done.

### Logic Aspect

### Database

### Models

### Charts

## What spoke who used this App

The app was installed in some devices for its owners to test/use the COVID-19 INFO app.
It was said to be intuitive, easy to use and direct to the point. Also, there was noted
that the app does not have many features besides its goal. Also this last observation
pointed the app interface as not polluted.
