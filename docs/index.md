## Application Goal and Who should use this App

The application goal is to provide people with updated information about COVID-19
status. It considers the whole world, as well as it does contemplate a country
perspective. Acknowledging its considerations, any user who holds an interest in
this subject may be pleased to use this app.

Therefore, the app affords the COVID-19's data visualization using charts to inform
and keep the user tuned about it. Yet, for those more concerned about the COVID-19
situation, the charts may provide insights to them.

## About technological choices

To develop the mobile app it was used Flutter. It is a Google's UI toolkit for crafting
beautiful, natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single
codebase. Therefore, the developed app can be used at least with either IOS and Android
devices.

With Flutter, the Visual Studio Code (VSCode) was chosen to integrate the development
tools. Also, in the VSCode, it was installed the Flutter extension (which can be found
[here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Dart-Code.flutter)) to
complete the set up of the development environment. As a personal choice, a real device
was used to run the app.
